## 📚 Relation to Hamiscopedia

Posts are the **educational layer** of Hamiscopedia — they explain the “why” and “how”, while **Snippets** and **Problem-Solving** show the “what” and “do”.

Together they form a complete learning flow:
1. **Read a Post** → understand the concept.  
2. **Run a Snippet** → see it in action.  
3. **Solve a Problem** → apply the knowledge.
