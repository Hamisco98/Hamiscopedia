# ⚙️ Hamiscopedia — Problem-Solving

Welcome to the **Hamiscopedia Problem-Solving** section — a growing collection of real coding challenges, algorithmic exercises, and logical problems designed to sharpen your problem-solving skills.

Each challenge is a **complete, runnable example** that focuses on a single idea — helping developers think critically, practice clean coding, and apply patterns to real-world problems.

## 🧩 What Is Problem-Solving?

In Hamiscopedia, *problem-solving* represents practical challenges built around common computer science concepts like:

- Arrays, Strings, and Collections  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Optimization and Complexity  
- Recursion and Dynamic Programming  
- Real-world Logic & Scenario-Based Problems  

Each folder here contains a single problem statement, solution, and optional unit tests — designed for you to **read, run, and reason** about.

---

## 🧠 Why It Exists

This section exists to help developers:
- Practice algorithmic thinking using clear, well-documented examples.  
- Improve their **coding logic** and **analysis skills**.  
- Build confidence by solving practical problems step-by-step.  
- Reinforce lessons from **Hamiscopedia Tips** and **Demos** through hands-on challenges.

## 🗂️ Structure Overview

```
/problem-solving/
  /arrays/
    two-sum/

      src/
      tests/
  /subarray/
    subarray-sum/
  /math/
  /strings/
```

### 🔹 Folder Convention

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **category** | Problem type (arrays, strings, math, recursion, etc.) |
| **problem-folder** | Problem title in lowercase, hyphen-separated (e.g., `two-sum`, `subarray-sum`) |

Each folder includes:
- `README.md` → explanation, examples, and complexity analysis  
- `src/` → code solution  
- `tests/` → validation for edge cases and correctness

## 📘 Problem README Template

Each problem folder follows a short structure like this:

```markdown
# Two Sum

**Category:** Arrays  
**Language:** C#  
**Difficulty:** 🟢 Easy  
**Created:** 2025-10-26  

---

### 🧩 Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`.

### 💡 Example
Input: `[2,7,11,15]`, target = 9  
Output: `[0,1]`  

### ⚙️ Approach
Use a dictionary to store visited numbers and check for the complement.

### 🧠 Complexity
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)
```
