# 🧰 Hamiscopedia — Extra

Welcome to the **Hamiscopedia Extra** section — a space for everything that extends beyond the main Hamiscopedia structure.  
This area collects **external resources, experiments, integrations, and research notes** that support or inspire the Hamiscopedia ecosystem.

> “Sometimes, the extra pieces are what make the big picture complete.” — *Hemisco*

## 💡 Purpose

The **Extra** section exists to store and organize everything that doesn’t fit neatly into Snippets, Demos, or Docs but still contributes to the project’s growth and learning.  
It’s the playground and archive for experimental ideas, prototypes, and resources.

Typical content includes:
- 🔗 External project links or submodules  
- 🧠 Research papers, diagrams, or idea drafts  
- 🧩 Prototype integrations or POC (Proof of Concept) apps  
- 🧰 Tools, scripts, and automation samples  
- 📦 Dependencies or utilities shared across projects

## 🧩 When to Use This Section

Use the **Extra** folder when you’re experimenting, testing, or documenting something that:

- Doesn’t belong in `/snippets`, `/demos`, or `/docs`.  
- May become part of a future Hamiscopedia feature or article.  
- Serves as a temporary or sandboxed environment for innovation.  
- Is an external reference or reusable asset you want to keep accessible.

> Think of it as Hamiscopedia’s “research lab” — where ideas are born, tested, and refined.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Prefix experimental folders with `exp-` (e.g., `exp-ai-integration`).  
- Add a short `README.md` inside each experiment explaining the purpose.  
- Use clear versioning and date stamps for prototypes (e.g., `2025-10-ai-search`).  
- Clean up outdated experiments periodically to keep the repo tidy.  
- Link promising ideas to their related Hamiscopedia section once matured.
